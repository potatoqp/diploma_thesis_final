1,pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis occurrence of precipitating antibodies against pseudomonas aeruginosa in relation to the concentration of sixteen serum proteins and the clinical and radiographical status of the lungs the significance of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients have been studied by means of immunoelectrophoretical analysis of patients sera for the number of precipitins against pseudomonas aeruginosa and the concentrations of serum proteins in addition the clinical and radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using scoring systems precipitins against pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrated in all sera the maximum number in one serum was the concentrations of of the serum proteins were significantly changed compared with matched control persons notably igg and iga were elevated and the acute phase proteins were changed the latter suggesting active tissue damage the concentrations of of the acute phase proteins notably haptoglobin were correlated to the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins the results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on the tissue of the respiratory tract
2,amylase content of mixed saliva in children salivary amylase levels were determined in normal subjects from birth until adult life and in children with conditions sometimes associated with low pancreatic amylase such as malnutrition coeliac disease and cystic fibrosis mixed saliva was collected under carefully standardised conditions and amylase was measured by the method of dahlqvist there was a wide scatter of values in the normal subjects but concentrations rose from very low levels at birth to reach adult levels by the age of months to year salivary amylase activity rose normally over ten weeks in one premature infant fed milk by gastrostomy thirteen children with coeliac disease and children with cystic fibrosis mostly had normal salivary amylase concentrations six out of malnourished children with jejunal villous atrophy of uncertain aetiology had low levels which rose to normal as recovery began
3,a clinical study of the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis by instrumental neutron activation analysis of sodium in nail clippings this article reports on the possibility of using instrumental neutron activation analysis inaa of sodium in nail clippings for diagnosing cystic fibrosis cf in children and adults for detecting heterozygotes and for screening in the neonatal period nail clippings from newborns cf patients two of them newborns healthy controls and heterozygotes were analyzed the discrimination between cf patients and controls was found to be precise for individuals above one year of age and inaa of nail clippings should be accepted as a diagnostic test for cf after this age heterozygotes could not be detected by the method during the first five days of life there is a big overlap between the values from normal newborns and those of cf children which makes the method invaluable for early screening for cf
