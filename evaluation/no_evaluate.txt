passage:1,pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis occurrence of precipitating antibodies against pseudomonas aeruginosa in relation to the concentration of sixteen serum proteins and the clinical and radiographical status of the lungs the significance of pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients have been studied by means of immunoelectrophoretical analysis of patients sera for the number of precipitins against pseudomonas aeruginosa and the concentrations of serum proteins in addition the clinical and radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using scoring systems precipitins against pseudomonas aeruginosa were demonstrated in all sera the maximum number in one serum was the concentrations of of the serum proteins were significantly changed compared with matched control persons notably igg and iga were elevated and the acute phase proteins were changed the latter suggesting active tissue damage the concentrations of of the acute phase proteins notably haptoglobin were correlated to the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins the results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on the tissue of the respiratory tract

passage:105,letter skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis dr economou mavrou and his colleagues appear to have misunderstood my previous note concerning skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis the range of normality varies in different climatic conditions and in aukland wrinkling does not appear in cool tap water c under minutes in normals skin wrinkling on immersion appears to be age related but is difficult to detect reliably in the newborn prior washing of the hands or immersion in sea water even the day before accelerates skin wrinkling as does warm weather i would suggest that normality needs redefining in athens if of normals were abnormal

Could be wrong, but its not clear. It appears to be age related but is difficult to detect reliably

passage:115,letter skin wrinkling and nerve function we were interested in professor elliott s description of early skin wrinkling in children with cystic fibrosis although this phenomenon may well be related to osmotic differences between skin and water it has been observed that skin wrinkling as seen on the finger pulp is fully dependent on an intact peripheral nerve supply this is a useful sign in peripheral nerve lesions and helpful in following recovery when the wrinkling returns furthermore it was our impression that in normal individuals wrinkling was more apparent on the left hand than on the right handed individuals however in a preliminary study using fingerprint densities measured by photometry no significant differences were found between the sides
